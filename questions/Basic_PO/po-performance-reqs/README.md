| ***Add them to the definition of 'Done'*** | Add them as items to the reports | Add a performance tester to the team | Use hardening Sprints to improve performance |


Feedback:

- Performance, like security, scalability and maintainability is a non-functional feature. Non-functional features are normally added to the definition of "Done" because they apply to all functional features. For some non-functional features, such as performance, it's possible to create non-technical, independent items in the Product Backlog. This is usually done when we have to make an improvement in the previously done features.
