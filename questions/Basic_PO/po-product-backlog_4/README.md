KSAs: 873, 916

## Answer
| A | ***B*** | C | D | E |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delay starting the sprint until all product backlog items are complete | ***Let the team start the first Sprint, and continue refining the Product Backlog*** | Let the Sprint begin, but only with the goal of completing the Product Backlog | All of the above | None of the above |


Feedback:

- It's not necessary to identify all product backlog items before starting the next sprint; afterall, the backlog is never really complete.
