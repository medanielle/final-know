## When is a Sprint Backlog item considered complete?

KSAs: 873

## Answer
| A | B | ***C*** | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| When all of its tasks are complete | When the Sprint is over | ***When everything is done based on the definition of "Done"*** | When the user acceptance tests are done |


Feedback:

- When the item is complete based on the definition of "Done", the end users can use it and it creates an Increment of working software which is potentially releasable. Note: if all the tasks for an item are complete, it doesn't necessarily mean that the item is complete because we might have forgotten to add some of the tasks.
