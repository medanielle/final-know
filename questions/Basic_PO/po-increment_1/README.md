## Which statement can be considered an Increment?

KSAs: 892

## Answer
| ***A*** | B | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ***A few new features in a usable state that are added to those delivered in the previous Sprints*** | A user interface layout design for the software | A UML diagram that describes the functionalities in the future Sprints | A decomposition of Product Backlog items into tasks that will be used in the future Sprints |


Feedback:

- Increments are a set of done Product Backlog items. All items should be non-technical and independent. The user interface design evolves throughout the project, as with the database architecture and other similar things. They are all part of functional features rather than separate ones.
