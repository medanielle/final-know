KSAs: 873, 916

## Answer
| A | B | C | ***D*** | E |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| All the tasks required for completing it should be identified | In a way that it can be "Done" in the time-boxed duration of one Sprint | In a way that it's clear enough for the developers | ***Both B and C*** | Both A and B |


Feedback:

- Items at the top of the Product Backlog should be small enough to fit in one Sprint. They should also be clear and detailed enough; but not too detailed (e.g. not with all tasks need to be identified) as it would be upfront planning. Tasks are created gradually during the Sprint. Product Backlog items require multiple expertise and usually done by multiple developers. Therefore, they are not assigned. Tasks, however, are assigned to the individual developers, while everyone stays accountable.
