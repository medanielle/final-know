Feedback:

- Although the Product Backlog can be influenced by others, the Product Owner takes care of the order. Part of the Sprint Review is to present the next set of potential items from the backlog. Comments are solicited, but decisions are made after the meeting. Collect any requests for new tickets to be added by customer.
