KSAs: 881, 889, 892

## Answer
| A | B | ***C*** | D | E |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Some Sprint Backlog items would be replaced with items from the Product Backlog, if the priorities change | Some Sprint Backlog items would be moved back to the Product Backlog to be completed in future Sprints | ***The scope may be re-negotiated as more is learned*** | All of the above | None of the above |


Feedback:

- During the Sprint, the Product Backlog items in the Sprint Backlog would not be added or removed but as more is learned, the scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team. This is mainly focused on the interpretation of the Product Backlog items and the tasks created by decomposing them.
