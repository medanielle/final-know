            "Incorrect: While arrays have constant access time, they must still be iterated over to find elements.",
            "Incorrect: Linked lists must iterate through their list to find or access an element.",
            "Correct: Hash tables use hashing functions to find elements without iterating.",
            "Incorrect: A stack must pop each of element off to find the one after it."
