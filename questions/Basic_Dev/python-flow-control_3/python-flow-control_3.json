            "The values list starts out empty in line 1 but is then filled with values in lines 3 and 4. Since a single parameter in the range function is non-inclusive, and begins at 0 and steps one by default, the sequential numbers 0 - 9 are accessed in line 3 and each one is multiplied by 2 and appended to the values list in line 4. When line 5 is reached, values = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]. Keeping in mind that passing two parameters into range sets the inclusive starting and non-inclusive ending range values, the loop starts at 3 and goes to the length of values minus 3; 10 total values minus 3 is 7, so the 6th index is the last one accessed. The final printed output is 6, 8, 10, and 12; all on their own line."
