        "choices": [
            "because int cannot be assigned to float variables",
            "otherwise floating point precision would be lost in the division",
            "float casting is required for int division",

        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": [
            "Incorrect: int can be assigned to floating point variables",
            "Correct: if x is not cast to a float, x/y would result in int division providing an int result and losing any floating point results. Casting one of the vaiables to a float will result in the equation evaluating to a floating point number",
            "Incorrect: float casting is not required but precision will be lost without it",
            "Incorrect: casting to a float will not reduce the size of the result"
