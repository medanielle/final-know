4 |     print (1)
5 | else:
6 |     print (2)
7 | 
```

## What will be the output of the above Python code snippet?

KSAs: 42, 43

## Answer
| A | B | ***C*** | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Amir | 1 | ***2*** | Bala |


Feedback:

- Looking at Line 3, the conditional compares 'amir' with anything in the names1 list. Since 'Amir' is not the same as 'amir', the condition becomes False and 2 is printed.
