- A) Incorrect: Linked list typically use a Node consisting of a data portion and a 'Next' pointer.
- B) Correct: Trees in data structures typically use a Node consisting of a data portion and a 'Right' and 'Left' pointer for each branch of the tree
- C) Incorrect: Double Linked list typically use a Node consisting of a data portion and a 'Next' and 'Previous' pointer.
