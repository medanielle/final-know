            "Incorrect: UDP is an alternative communications protocol to TCP used primarily for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet.",
            "Incorrect: ARP is a protocol used by the Internet Protocol (IP), specifically IPv4, to map IP network addresses to the hardware addresses used by a data link protocol."
