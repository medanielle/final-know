            "Correct: This is the proper way to declare a Python function.",
            "Incorrect: A proper Python function declaration requires the def keyword before the function prototype.",
            "Incorrect: Without the colon it would be a variable. To be a function header, it needs to be preceded by the keyword def and () needs to be inserted between the end of create_stuff and the colon.",
            "Incorrect: func is not a valid keyword in Python and should be changed with def. Also, a trailing colon is required."
