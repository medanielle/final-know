Feedback:

- A) Correct: This is the proper way to declare a Python function.
- B) Incorrect: A proper Python function declaration requires the def keyword before the function prototype.
- C) Incorrect: Without the colon it would be a variable. To be a function header, it needs to be preceded by the keyword def and () needs to be inserted between the end of create_stuff and the colon.
- D) Incorrect: func is not a valid keyword in Python and should be changed with def. Also, a trailing colon is required.
