            "Incorrect: The Acknowledgement (ACK) flag confirms the receipt of the prior segment.",
            "Correct: The Fin (FIN) flag signifies a proper termination of the connection, as there is no more data to transmit.",
            "Incorrect: The Reset (RST) flag allows for the spontaneous termination of a connection.",
            "Incorrect: The Synchronize (SYN) flag is the first sent to begin a TCP connection, specifically this flag calls for the hosts to synchronize sequence numbers."
