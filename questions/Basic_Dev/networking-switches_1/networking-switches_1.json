        "answer": 2,
        "explanation": [
            "Incorrect: A hub is a common connection point for devices in a network. Hubs are devices commonly used to connect segments of a LAN.",
            "Incorrect: Repeaters are used in transmission systems to regenerate analog or digital signals distorted by transmission loss.",
            "Correct: A switch uses Content Addressable Memory (CAM) tables which stores information such as MAC addresses available on physical ports with their MAC addresses.",
            "Incorrect: A DHCP server automatically assigns an IP address and other information to each host on the network so they can communicate efficiently with other endpoints."
