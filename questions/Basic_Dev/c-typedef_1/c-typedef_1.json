            "Incorrect: typedef does not create variables, it creates a new type that acts like the type specified.",

            "Incorrect: C can not allocate memory on the stack at runtime. typedef creates a new type that acts like the type specified.",
            "Incorrect: typedef can be used to define structs but it is only defining a single unsigned int as counter."
