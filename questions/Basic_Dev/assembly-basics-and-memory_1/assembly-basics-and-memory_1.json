            "a copy of the cl contents",

        "answer": 2,
        "explanation": [
            "Incorrect: Moving a smaller register (c1) to a larger register (rax) will result in the cl contents being placed in the rightmost bits",
            "Incorrect: The movzs puts all zeros in unfilled bits therefore there will be no residual data",
            "Correct: The movzx puts zeros in all unfilled bits from a mov command, because cl only has 8 bits, the leftmost 56 bits (7 bytes) are filled with zeros",
            "Incorrect: this mov command moves contents of a register not an address"
