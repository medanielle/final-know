            "Incorrect: people[2][\"Hank\"] is invalid syntax because list indices must be integers, not string.",
            "Incorrect: people[3][2] tries to access the third item, index 2, in a fourth nested list, index 3; however, both do not exist and are out of range. Remember, the index always starts at 0.",
            "Incorrect: people[2,1] tries to use a tuple of (2,1) to access a list item but this is invalid syntax because list indices must be integers.",
            "Correct: people[2][1] accesses the second item, index 1, in the third nested list, index 2."
