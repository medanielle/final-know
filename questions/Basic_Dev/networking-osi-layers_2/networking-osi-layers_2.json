        "choices": [
            "The Network layer is divided into two sublayers: Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access control (MAC); whereas the Transport layer performs segmentation and flow control.",
            "The Network layer takes information it receives from the session layer and passes it to the Transport layer; the transport layer then passes this information to the data link layer.",
            "The Network layer is responsible for routing and addressing whereas the Transport layer handles end-to-end delivery of a message.",

        "explanation": [
            "Incorrect: The Data Link layer is divided into LLC and MAC layers, not the Network layer.",
            "Incorrect: The Network layer takes information it receives from the Transport layer and passes it to the Data Link layer; the reverse is also true. The Transport layer passes information between the Network and Session layers.",
            "Correct: The network layer handles routing and addressing and the transport layer takes care of end-to-end message delivery.",
            "Incorrect: The transport layer is responsible for connection oriented and connection-less services, not the Network layer, and the Session layer handles establishing, using, and terminating connections, not the Transport layer."
