            "Incorrect: Since Python doesn't require type declarations for variables, the int is not necessary and is a syntax error.",
            "Correct: This is the proper way to iterate through each item in a list.",
            "Incorrect: range(a) is in a position where an identifier, i.e. variable, is expected; you cannot assign the item's value to a function call.",
            "Incorrect: The loop has no identifier, i.e. variable, to use for each item in range(ages)."
