            "Line 4 declares a variable artist of type struct person simultaneously when the struct is defined. Accessing individual elements within a struct variable is done by using the . operator: artist.name, artist.age etc.  If artist were declared as a pointer, then accessing each element would use the -> operator such as:  artist->name, artist->age."
