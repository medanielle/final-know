            "Data Link has two sublayers: a Media Access Control (MAC) layer that directly interfaces with the network medium and a LLC Layer that controls frame synchronization, flow control and error checking.",
            "Network provides switching and routing technologies, creating logical paths; it doesn't have a LLC layer.",
            "Session establishes, manages and terminates connections between applications; it doesn't have a LLC layer.",
            "Physical conveys the bit stream - electrical impulse, light or radio signal through the network at the electrical and mechanical level; it doesn't have a LLC layer."
