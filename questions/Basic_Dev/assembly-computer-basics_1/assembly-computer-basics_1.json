        "explanation": [
            "Incorrect: this instruction would replace the memory address in rax with the value 100",
            "Correct: to access the data for a given memory address, you use the [] brackets",
            "Incorrect: this command would simply modify the memory address",
            "Incorrect: the mov command needs to be followed by a valid operand (in this case a valid register name)"
