- B) Correct: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is connection oriented, provides error checking, and provides reliability of communication.
- C) Incorrect: Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)  is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Not a networking protocol.
