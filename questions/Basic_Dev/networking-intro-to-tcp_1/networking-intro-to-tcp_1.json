            "Incorrect: File Transfer Protocol (FTP) uses TCP, which is connection oriented, does not provide error checking and does not provide reliability of communication",

            "Incorrect: Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)  is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Not a networking protocol.",
            "Incorrect: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol. Not a networking protocol."
