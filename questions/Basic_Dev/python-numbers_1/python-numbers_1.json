            "Line 1 creates a sequential list of 5 numbers, starting with 2. Then every number in the list (line 2) is compared to see if that number modulus 2 equals 0 (line 3). Because we are dividing by 2 and comparing the remainder with 0, all even numbers will be True and odd False. If the statement is True then the number squared is printed (line 4); otherwise, just the number is printed (line 6). Both print statements use the space character instead of the \n character (as seen with end = \" \"); this causes all numbers to stay on the same line. Therefore, the output is 4 3 16 5 36."
