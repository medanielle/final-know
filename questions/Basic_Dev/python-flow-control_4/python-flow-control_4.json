            "Looking at line 3, the range input parameters are as follows, from left to right: starting index (inclusive), ending index (non-inclusive), and step. Therefore, the loop starts at index 2, goes the entire length of the list, and steps by 2. So the first value accessed is 7 (at index 2), then step 2 to the next value of 11 (at index 4), then step 2 to the final value of 15 (at index 6)."
